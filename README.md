**Electron-Angular1** This is a starter application to get you started with Angular1.
Once you have cloned this repo, open terminal and run "npm install" and "npm start"

You can read more about Electron at http://electron.atom.io but in short it packages the chromium JS engine and lets you create desktop apps for Mac and Windows using web technologies.
Pretty nifty!
